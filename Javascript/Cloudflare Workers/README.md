# Cloudflare Workers

The Cloudflare Workers runtime is built on top of the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. The Workers runtime is updated at least once a week, to at least the version of V8 that is currently used by Google Chrome's stable release. This means you can safely use the latest JavaScript features, with no need for transpilers.

npm create cloudflare
