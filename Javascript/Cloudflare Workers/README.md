# Cloudflare Workers

The Cloudflare Workers runtime is built on top of the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. The Workers runtime is updated at least once a week, to at least the version of V8 that is currently used by Google Chrome's stable release. This means you can safely use the latest JavaScript features, with no need for transpilers.
